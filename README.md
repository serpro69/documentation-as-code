# Living Docs || Documentation as Code

Slides for presentation **Living Docs || Documentation as Code**

## Abstract

Documentation should be as important as working software itself. After all, just like your automated tests, documentation is also part of the software.

There are a lot of "best practices" when it comes to writing code: DRY, KISS, SOLID and whatnot. But what about documenting what that code does and how to work with it? Some would say that "good code does not need documentation". Others would go even further to say that "good code does not need testing". Coming from the world of testing, and having seen issues with software documentation in almost every project I worked with in the past - I strongly disagree with both of those statements. I would rather say that "good code implies presence of good documentation (and good tests)".

But why do we need to document software? And more importantly, why do we often neglect this aspect of software development? And how can we solve some of the issues we often face while documenting things? These are some of the questions I'm going to address in this talk.
