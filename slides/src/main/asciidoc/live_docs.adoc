It’s also not about "Living Documentation" that comes from BDD.

But it is about **keeping the documentation alive.**

== If it isn't documented – it doesn't exist

> **"If it isn't documented, it doesn't exist."** Not only does it have to be doc'd, but it was to be explained and taught and demonstrated. Do that, and people will be excited -- not about your documentation, but about your product.{empty}footnote:[http://www.mikepope.com/blog/DisplayBlog.aspx?permalink=1680]

== Lack of documentation is the reason good libraries fail

> "Lack of documentation. No matter how wonderful your library is and how intelligent its design, **if you're the only one who understands it, it doesn't do any good**. Documentation means not just autogenerated API references, but also annotated examples and in-depth tutorials. You need all three to make sure your library can be easily adopted."
(Nicholas Zakas, the number one reason why good JavaScript libraries fail)

> There's one other thing which can really make or break a JavaScript library, and it's surprising how often it's overlooked, because **the same thing makes or breaks an awful lot of software in other fields: documentation**. The greatest library in the world would fail if the only way to learn it was reading the code. **There is absolutely no substitute for full, well-written documentation.**
(James Bennett, https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2007/jan/22/choosing-javascript-library/[choosing a JavaScript library])

== "Did you read the docs before opening this issue?"

== But why don't people read the docs?

// TODO leave empty?
